# National Park Bookmarks React Native App Demo

This is a demo project that uses React Native to build an iOS and Android App.

When run locally, a device with [Expo](https://expo.io/) installed can run the app. Expo also supports locally installed simulators such as the free (for MacOS) iOS simulator that is part of XCode.

The project is based on a web demo available at [https://github.com/damontgomery/nps-react-native](https://github.com/damontgomery/nps-react-native)

The project also uses a hosted GraphQL server which stands in front of the National Park Service's API.

See [https://github.com/damontgomery/nps-graphql](https://github.com/damontgomery/nps-graphql)

For this App, GrapQL integration is powered by [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).
